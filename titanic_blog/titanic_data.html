      <h1>Titanic Passenger Classification Assignment</h1>

      <p>
        In this blog post, I'll discuss my approach and findings from the
        Titanic Passenger Classification assignment. The goal was to predict
        whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In the field of data science, the Titanic dataset serves as a classic
        playground for predictive modeling. The goal is to develop a model that
        predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various
        attributes. This exercise not only hones our data science skills but
        also allows us to delve into the historical context of the Titanic
        disaster.
      </p>

      <h3>Data exploration and visualization</h3>
      <p>
        Before diving into the code, let's explore the dataset and gain insights
        into its structure. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn can
        help us understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and
        spot potential correlations. By visualizing aspects like passenger
        demographics, ticket class, and survival rates, we can form initial
        hypotheses and guide our preprocessing steps.

      <h3>Data pre-processing</h3>
      <p>
        Effective data preprocessing is crucial for building robust machine
        learning models. In this step, we handle missing values, normalize and
        standardize attributes if needed, and encode nominal and ordinal
        attributes. Additionally, we remove irrelevant attributes such as 'ID',
        'Ticket', and 'Name' that may not contribute significantly to the
        predictive power of the model.

      <h3>Classification models and hyperparamete tuning</h3>
      <p>
        Now, let's experiment with various classification models to identify the
        most suitable one for our task. We'll utilize a set of estimators,
        including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest
        Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and
        XGBoost. To ensure robustness, we'll explore different hyperparameters,
        specifically focusing on the number of splits for cross-validation with
        values of 5 and 10.

      <h3>Results and Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In conclusion, our Titanic classification assignment journey unveiled
        valuable insights into data science and machine learning. After thorough
        experimentation, the Decision Tree Classifier emerged as the top
        performer, boasting the highest accuracy with 10 splits for
        cross-validation.This exercise emphasizes the importance of meticulous
        model selection and hyperparameter tuning. The skills developed here
        extend beyond the Titanic dataset, providing a foundation for solving
        diverse real-world problems.
